# Abstract

Reproducibility of data is crucial to science. Ease of reproducibility has numerous advantages and there are two very useful tools to aid with this. Galaxy is a workflow manager that ties together and manages the tools and scripts you use to process and analyse data. Docker is a powerful tool that you can use to encapsulate and isolate the runtime environments of your tools from the varied system environments they may face. With the ever growing scale of the datasets being processed, utilising large scale cloud computing is an economical option to generate results faster. Here we will discuss the various features of these tools and how to integrate them together on Amazon Cloud computing systems. We will also demonstrate how to integrate any tool or script that is not already available through Galaxy.
